      <h1>The BizUply Dashboard: Full Control at a Glance</h1>

      <h2>What is the BizUply dashboard and why it matters</h2>
      <p>
        The dashboard is your central control panel in BizUply. It brings together
        all essential business data in one clear, accessible view, allowing you
        to monitor activity in real time, understand performance, and identify
        trends or issues early.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of relying on intuition, the dashboard enables data-driven
        decisions that help you manage and grow your business more effectively.
      </p>

      <h2>Why the dashboard should be a core business tool</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All key systems—calendar, CRM, and analytics—are consolidated in one
          place.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can make faster, more accurate decisions based on real, current
          data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Seasonal patterns become clear, allowing better planning.
        </li>
        <li>
          When enabled, the AI Partner provides real-time, actionable
          recommendations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What the dashboard includes</h2>

      <h3>Customer Reviews</h3>
      <p>
        This section displays reviews submitted by your customers, offering a
        clear picture of overall satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p><strong>How to use this data:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Track customer sentiment over time.</li>
        <li>Identify recurring strengths and improvement areas.</li>
        <li>
          Respond to reviews when appropriate to demonstrate engagement and
          professionalism.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> If customers frequently mention friendly
        service, emphasize it in your business description or marketing
        messaging.
      </p>

      <p>
        A centralized view of upcoming and past appointments, synchronized with

        adding additional time slots or extended service hours.
      </p>

      <h3>Appointments by Month</h3>
      <p>
        A visual chart showing how appointment volume changes across months.
