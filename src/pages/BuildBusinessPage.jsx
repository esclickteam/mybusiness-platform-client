      <h2>🧷 Editing Your Business Page – Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Your business page on BizUply isn’t just a “digital business card.” It’s your storefront.
        It’s where customers first discover you, get impressed by your services, consume information,
        ask questions, and sometimes even book an appointment—without ever speaking to you.
        A well-built page is the difference between a curious visitor and a customer who takes action.
        Every part of it should be crafted with care and intention.
      </p>

      <h2>🧾 The Main Tab – The Heart of the Page</h2>

      <h3>✍ Business Name</h3>
      <p>
        Your name is the first thing users see. It appears in search results, at the top of your page,
        and in conversations. Make sure it’s clear, professional, and includes your field.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to write it:</strong><br />
        Use your full name or brand name, then add your specialty.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hagit Amsalem — Natural Cosmetics</li>
        <li>Yossi Cohen — Plumbing & 24/7 Emergency Service</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Adding the specialty helps search understand what you do and improves your visibility.
      </p>

      <h3>🧾 Business Description</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most important sections—this is where you tell your story, what you do, and what makes you unique.
      </p>
      <p><strong>How to write a great description?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a warm, approachable tone.</li>
        <li>State your main service and what differentiates you from others.</li>
        <li>Mention experience, certifications, specialties, and even your treatment/service approach.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Sample professional paragraph — Hagit Amsalem:</strong></p>
      <p>
        I’m Hagit Amsalem, a certified cosmetician specializing in natural facials with only organic ingredients.
        I combine 12+ years of experience with personal attention for every client—so the treatment calms both skin and mind.
        My studio is in Ramat Gan. You’re invited to a unique and relaxing experience.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Sample professional paragraph — Yossi Cohen:</strong></p>
      <p>
        I’m Yossi Cohen, a licensed plumber with 15+ years of experience, providing repairs, leak detection,
        and 24/7 emergency service in the central region. I’m committed to fast, reliable, professional work,
        using advanced equipment to diagnose issues with minimal disruption.
      </p>

      <h3>☎ Contact Details — Phone & Email</h3>
      <p>
        These let customers reach you directly—so accuracy is a must. A small typo can cost you leads.
        If you use WhatsApp Business, mention it in the description or add a relevant icon in your visuals.
      </p>

      <h3>🏷 Category</h3>
      <p>
        The category helps place your page correctly in the system. Choose the one that best represents your
        primary service. Even if you offer several services, focus on the main keyword—e.g., “Permanent Makeup,”
        “Medical Massage,” “Nails,” “Natural Cosmetics,” etc.
      </p>

      <h3>📍 City</h3>
      <p>
        Choose the main city where you provide service. Even if you’re mobile or work across multiple cities,
        list the place where most work happens—or where your studio is located.
      </p>

      <h2>🖼 Gallery Tab — Visual Impression</h2>
      <p>
        The gallery lets you show, not just tell. One picture is worth a thousand words—and on mobile,
        it can be the difference between browsing and booking.
      </p>
      <p><strong>What to include?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Real work: before/after, process, and results.</li>
        <li>Your workspace: studio, station, clean and organized equipment.</li>
        <li>Short videos that convey professionalism and confidence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid low-quality or compressed images.</li>
        <li>Five excellent photos beat fifteen mediocre ones.</li>
        <li>Avoid heavy filters—customers want authenticity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>⭐ Reviews Tab — Building Trust</h2>
      <p>
        Only real customers can leave reviews—this creates high credibility. Each review includes a rating
        and affects your overall score.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why reviews matter:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>They add legitimacy and trust.</li>
        <li>They boost your rating and visibility.</li>
        <li>They help new customers decide.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>How to encourage reviews smartly?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Ask a customer:<br />
        “If you were happy, it would really help me if you could leave a short review on my BizUply profile 😊
        It helps new customers find me.”
      </p>

      <h2>📅 Calendar Tab — Booking</h2>
      <p>
        The calendar lets customers book appointments digitally—no phone calls or long message threads.
      </p>
      <p><strong>How to set it up:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each service needs a clear name, estimated duration (in minutes), price, and description.</li>
        <li>If there’s a difference between simple/short and complex/long services—create separate services.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Good service example — Hagit Amsalem:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Service name: Deep Natural Facial</li>
        <li>Duration: 75 minutes</li>
        <li>Price: ₪290</li>
        <li>Description: Deep cleanse with green clay mask and soothing care, tailored for sensitive skin.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Good service example — Yossi Cohen:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Service name: Sink Clog Removal</li>
        <li>Duration: 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Price: ₪250</li>
        <li>Description: Light clog removal using professional powered tools, includes functionality check.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>💬 Messages Tab — Direct Chat with Customers</h2>
      <p>
        Customers can contact you easily from your page. All messages appear in the “Customer Messages” tab,
        and you’ll get a notification.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Tips for handling messages:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reply as quickly as possible—service speed matters.</li>
        <li>Write clearly and politely.</li>
        <li>If questions repeat, add them to your FAQ tab.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>❓ FAQ Tab</h2>
      <p>
        Use this space to answer repeat questions in advance. It saves time, improves service,
        and signals organization and professionalism.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Good examples:</strong></p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Question</th>
            <th>Answer</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Can I pay by credit card?</td>
            <td>Yes—credit card, Bit, and PayBox are accepted.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Does the service include a repair?</td>
            <td>Yes—one repair is included, up to 60 days.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Can I book on Fridays?</td>
            <td>Yes—by prior arrangement only.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>✅ Save & Finish</h2>
