      <h2>üß∑ Editing the Business Page ‚Äì Why is it Important?</h2>
      <p>
        Your business page on Asclic is not just a "digital business card." It is the showcase of your business. This is where customers are first exposed to you, get impressed by your services, consume information, ask questions, and sometimes even schedule an appointment ‚Äì all without even talking to you. A well-constructed business page is the difference between an interested customer and a customer who takes action. Therefore, every part of it needs to be built with thought and attention.
      </p>

      <h2>üßæ The Main Tab ‚Äì The Heart of the Page</h2>

      <h3>‚úç Business Name</h3>
      <p>
        Your name is the first thing that catches the user's eye. It appears in search results, in the page title, and in communications. Therefore, it is important that it is clear, representative, and includes your field.
      </p>
      <p><strong>How to write?</strong><br />
      Write your full name or your brand name, and then add your area of expertise.</p>
      <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hagit Amsalem ‚Äì Natural Cosmetics</li>
        <li>Yossi Cohen ‚Äì Plumbing and Emergency Services 24/7</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Adding the field will also help the search engine understand what you do and improve your visibility.</p>

      <h3>üßæ Business Description</h3>
      <p>
        This is one of the most important sections ‚Äì here you tell about yourself, what you do, and what makes you unique.
      </p>
      <p><strong>How to write a good description?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Address in a personal tone, at eye level.</li>
        <li>Write about your main service, but also what makes you stand out compared to others in the field.</li>
        <li>It is recommended to mention experience, training, special areas of expertise, and even a therapeutic or service approach.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example of a professional description paragraph ‚Äì Hagit Amsalem:</strong></p>
      <p>
        I am Hagit Amsalem, a certified cosmetologist specializing in natural facial treatments with only organic materials. I combine over 12 years of experience with personal attention to each client, aiming to provide treatment that soothes both the skin and the soul. My clinic is located in Ramat Gan and invites you to a unique treatment experience.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Example of a professional description paragraph ‚Äì Yossi Cohen:</strong></p>
      <p>
        I am Yossi Cohen, a certified plumber with over 15 years of experience, providing repair services, leak detection, and emergency services 24/7 in the central area. I am committed to professional, fast, and reliable service, using advanced equipment to detect faults with minimal damage.
      </p>

      <h3>‚òé Contact Information ‚Äì Phone and Email</h3>
      <p>
        These are the details that will allow the customer to contact you directly ‚Äì so it is essential to ensure they are accurate. A small mistake in the number or email can lead to the loss of potential customers. If you use a business WhatsApp, you can also mention this in the description or add a suitable icon in the images.
      </p>

      <h3>üè∑ Category</h3>
      <p>
        The category helps to sort your page within the system. Choose the category that best represents your main service. Even if you offer additional services, it is important to focus on the central keyword ‚Äì for example, "Permanent Makeup," "Medical Massage," "Nails," "Natural Cosmetics," etc.
      </p>

      <h3>üìç City</h3>
      <p>
        Choose the main city where you provide service. Even if you are mobile or work in several cities, it is better to specify the place where most of the work is actually done, or where the clinic is located.
      </p>

      <h2>üñº Gallery Tab ‚Äì The Visual Impression</h2>
      <p>
        The gallery is the place where you can show and not just tell. A picture is worth a thousand words ‚Äì and for a customer browsing from a mobile device, it is also worth an invitation.
      </p>
      <p><strong>What should be included in the gallery?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pictures of real work: before/after, processes, results.</li>
        <li>Pictures of the work environment: clinic, work station, clean and organized equipment.</li>
        <li>If you have short videos ‚Äì they can convey professionalism and confidence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What is important to remember?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not upload reduced or low-quality images.</li>
        <li>Better to have 5 excellent images than 15 mediocre ones.</li>
        <li>Do not use excessive filters ‚Äì customers want to see the truth.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>‚≠ê Reviews Tab ‚Äì Your Trust with the Customer</h2>
      <p>
        The system allows only real customers to leave a review ‚Äì this creates high credibility. Each review will appear along with the rating, and it affects the overall score of your business.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why are reviews so important?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>They provide legitimacy and credibility to the business.</li>
        <li>They raise your rating and increase visibility.</li>
        <li>They help the new customer make a decision.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>How to encourage reviews wisely?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Ask the customer: <br />
        "If you were satisfied, it would help me a lot if you could leave a short review on my profile on Asclic üòä It helps new customers find me."
      </p>

      <h2>üìÖ Calendar Tab ‚Äì Appointment Scheduling</h2>
      <p>
        The calendar allows customers to book an appointment digitally, without phone calls and lengthy communications.
      </p>
      <p><strong>How to build the calendar?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>For each service, give a clear name, estimated time (in minutes), price, and description.</li>
        <li>If there is a difference between a simple short service or a complex service ‚Äì define them separately.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Good example of service definition ‚Äì Hagit Amsalem:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Service Name: Natural Deep Facial Cleansing</li>
        <li>Time: 75 minutes</li>

      </p>
      <p><strong>Good examples:</strong></p>

          <tr>
            <th>Question</th>
