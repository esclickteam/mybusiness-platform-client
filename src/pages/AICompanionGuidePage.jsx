      <h1>Artificial Intelligence in BizUply</h1>

      <h2>Why modern businesses need AI</h2>
      <p>
        In an increasingly competitive environment, customers expect fast,
        accurate, and personalized responses. Managing a business based solely
        on intuition or manual processes is no longer sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence enables data-driven decision-making by analyzing
        real-time business activity. It helps businesses operate more efficiently,
        respond faster to changes, and remain competitive in dynamic markets.
